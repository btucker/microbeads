  "closed_reason": "Assessed as low priority optimization. Current implementation handles 10k issues in <10s for list operations (per performance tests). Index file adds complexity (sync issues, corruption handling, merge conflicts) without significant benefit for typical use cases (<1000 issues). Recommend implementing only if real-world usage shows performance problems. Current design is sufficient.",
