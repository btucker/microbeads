(2) Git Trailers - immutable once committed, tied to specific commits. Neither suits issue tracking which needs mutable, commit-independent issues with efficient querying. Current JSON-on-orphan-branch approach is well-suited: flexible, easy to inspect/query, independent of main branch. Recommend keeping current design.",
